# rick-roll-bot
This turns the Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up video into ASCII text and puts it into discord

you will need to install python for this to begin with.

you will need some modules, type this into powershell:
   pip install Discord
   pip install OpenCv
   
first, change all the paths and make a discord bot. Get the token and paste it in to the main rick roll part of the code.
Once all the paths are changed and the modules are installed you can run the videotoframes.py program. After everything here
has been completed you can run the main rickrollbot.py program and the discord bot should start.
